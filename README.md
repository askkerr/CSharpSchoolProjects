# C# Examples

This is a program in C# that allows users to add good and bad aliens to a spaceship.
The age, name, and color of each alien are stored, and when the aliens do battle the colors of the aliens affect
the amount of damage they do to one another.

The main file to run the program is "Program.cs". The program was written and test-compiled in Visual Studio 2019.
