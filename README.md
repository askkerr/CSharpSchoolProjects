# Austin Kerr

Hello, my name is Austin. 
I am a current student at Austin Peay State University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Theory and Systems and a Mathematics minor.
My expected graduation date is currently set for May of 2022.

While a bit diversified in my courses, I am very comfortable with Java, Javascript, and frontend development.
I have applied to and am hoping to begin graduate school summer of 2022 with a major in Information Assurance and Security.
I enjoy 3D printing, hobby designing on CAD programs, and military history.

Provided in this repo are a few examples of some of the projects in various languages I worked with during my undergraduate studies as well as my resume.
